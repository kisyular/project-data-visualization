# FordBike Exploration Project

## By: Rellika Kisyula

## Dataset

The Ford GoBike dataset contains anonymized trip data for the bike-sharing system from June 2017 to April 2019. **However, I decided to only use the data in the year 2018 (January 2018 to December 2018).** The data includes information on individual bike rides such as trip duration, start and end time, start and end station, bike ID, and user type. Additionally, demographic data such as age, gender, and membership type is provided for some users.

I manually downloaded the datasets from the [System Data | Bay Wheels | Lyft](https://www.lyft.com/bikes/bay-wheels/system-data) page. The datasets were in the form of a zip file. I extracted the zip files and saved the csv files in the `data` folder as this notebook. The zip files are in `data/zip_files` folder.

I then unzipped the files using `zipfile` and saved them in the `data/data_files` folder. I then read the csv files into a pandas dataframe and concatenated them into one dataframe. I then saved the dataframe as a csv file in the `data` folder as `bike_data.csv`.

### Wrangling Efforts

-   I added a column for the year, month, day, hour, and day of the week to the dataframe by extracting the information from the `start_time` column.
-   I calculated the distance travelled in kilometres using the `haversine` function and added it to the dataframe as `distance`.
-   I converted the `start_time` and `end_time` columns to datetime objects.
-   I also added a column for the age of the user by subtracting the birth year from the year the data was collected (2018).

## Summary of Findings

> In terms of time usage, bike rides were heavily used at 8 AM and 5 PM, indicating that individuals are primarily using the bike share system for commuting to and from work or school during peak morning and evening hours. I also discovered that there is a significant drop in the number of rides starting at 11:00 PM to 4:00 AM. Furthermore, the majority of rides were taken during weekdays, suggesting that the bike share system is primarily being used for weekday commuting or transportation, likely for work or school-related purposes.

> The most popular starting points for bike rides were found to be the San Francisco Ferry Building (Harry Bridges Plaza), San Francisco Caltrain Station 2 (Townsend St at 4th St), and San Francisco Caltrain (Townsend St at 4th St), which are likely transportation hubs such as train and bus stations, making them convenient and easily accessible starting points for people commuting to work or other destinations.

> An interesting observation from my analysis was that there were more subscribers than customers in the bike sharing service. This could be because the service caters more towards long-term users who can benefit from the subscription model. Additionally, the subscription model may offer discounts or other benefits, which could encourage users to sign up and contribute to the higher number of subscribers.

> When looking at the duration of rides taken between January to December 2018, I found that the majority of rides lasted between 5 to 20 minutes, with a right-skewed distribution indicating that most rides were short. This trend suggests that the bike share system is primarily being used for short trips, such as commuting to and from work or school. However, riders tend to ride for longer durations on weekends, potentially using the bike share system for leisure and recreation. Interestingly, the customer category had longer ride durations throughout the week than the subscriber category, which may be because customer category riders use the bike share system more for leisure and recreation.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> For this analysis, I want to see how users utilize the bike sharing system. The main focus is on when the people ride the bikes in terms hours of the day, days of the week, and months of the year.

> For this analysis, I would like to see the most popular starting points for bike rides.

> I would also like to explore the characteristics of the users who used the bike sharing system. I would like to understand when certain categories of users (gender, user type, and age) use the bike sharing system.

> Finally I would like to analyze the duration of the rides in minutes, the distance of travel in kilometres, and what category of users use the bike sharing system the longest.
